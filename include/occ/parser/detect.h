// Target format detection.
//
// `occ run` has to decide which engine a path belongs to before it can do
// anything with it, and the decision has to be made from the file itself
// rather than from its name. A file called `app.apk` that is an ELF binary
// and a file called `image` that is an Android package are both possible,
// and inferring the format from the extension produces a confident wrong
// answer in both cases.
//
// The detector reads the bytes. Each format is identified by a signature at
// a fixed offset plus a set of structural constraints that a coincidence
// would have to satisfy as well. The result carries the evidence that
// produced it, because a user who disagrees with the detection needs to see
// which bytes it was based on.
