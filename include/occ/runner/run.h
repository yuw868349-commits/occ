// A run of a target under observation.
//
// The runner is the layer that knows how the three pieces fit together: the
// parser says what the image wants, the container builds the environment it
// runs in, and the observer reports what it did. None of the three knows
// about the others, which is what keeps each one testable on its own.
//
// What the runner adds is the sequence. It reads the target, decides whether
// the image is one this build can run, builds the container configuration,
// starts the target, reports every fact it has about it, and collects the
// exit status. The order of the reported facts is part of the interface: an
// image_loaded event is written before any mapping event, so a consumer that
// reads the stream top to bottom has a complete picture at every point.
