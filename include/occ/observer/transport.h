// The remote debugger protocol over a socket.
//
// DebugServer answers packets. It does not own a connection, which is what
// makes it testable by feeding it strings, but something has to carry those
// strings to a debugger and read the replies back. That is this header's
// whole job, and it is deliberately the only part of the debugger that knows
// about file descriptors.
//
// The listener binds a loopback port rather than a wildcard one. A stub that
// traced a process can hand out the ability to read and write that process's
// memory to anything that can reach the socket, so the port is not something
// to expose by default: a debugger that is not on this machine is not a
// debugger this tool has a use case for, and "run it in a container" is a
// better answer than "make the port private".
