#pragma once

// The GDB Remote Serial Protocol.
//
// The protocol is a byte stream of packets, each framed by '$' and '#',
// with a checksum of the payload after the '#'. It is chosen over inventing
// one because every debugger front end already speaks it: a target running
// under occ can be attached to from gdb, lldb, or any of the editors that
// drive them, without a plugin.
//
// The parser here is a state machine over bytes rather than a line reader,
// because the framing characters can appear inside a payload when it is
// escaped, and a reader that split on '#" would mis-frame a packet that
// contained one. The state is also what lets a partial read be resumed: a
// serial port and a socket both deliver bytes in whatever size chunks they
// feel like, and a parser that assumed a whole packet per read would work
// on a local socket and fail on everything else.
//
// What is implemented is the packet set a debugger needs to attach, read
// and write memory, inspect registers, set breakpoints, and single step.
// Packets outside that set are answered with an empty response, which the
// protocol defines as "not supported" -- an answer a debugger understands,
// rather than a disconnect it would have to guess at.
