// The event stream.
//
// Every fact a run produces leaves through one writer, and the writer emits
// one JSON object per line. A line-oriented format is chosen because it is
// readable while the run is still going: a consumer tails the stream, parses
// one object at a time, and never has to hold the whole run in memory. The
// same bytes are what a terminal shows and what a tool consumes, so there is
// no second code path that only ever gets exercised by one of the two.
//
// Field order is fixed by the encoder rather than by a map, because a
// stable order makes two runs of the same target diff cleanly, and diffing
// two runs is the main thing a caller does with this.
//
// Times are monotonic nanoseconds since the stream was opened. A wall clock
// would make two runs on two machines incomparable, and this stream is
// meant to be compared.
