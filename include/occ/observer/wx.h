// The write-then-execute tracker.
//
// A target that decodes its own code has to write the decoded bytes
// somewhere and then run them, and the run is what the tracker watches for.
// The two halves are observed differently:
//
//   - The write is seen with a hardware watch, which is why the watch has to
//     be on a page whose writability says something. A watch on a page the
//     target maps without execute permission is the interesting case,
//     because the write is then a write to memory that is not yet code.
//   - The execute is seen with a watch of its own on the entry point, or by
//     sampling the permission of the region after the write.
//
// What is reported is a transition, not a single event: a region that was
// written and then became executable. The transitions are deduplicated,
// because a decoder that writes one byte at a time produces a write per
// byte and a report per byte is a report nobody can read.
//
// The tracker does not decide whether a transition is hostile. It reports
// the address, the size, and the fact. A caller that has a policy applies
// it; a tracker that applied one would be a tracker with an opinion about
// what a legitimate program does, and self-modifying code is a legitimate
// technique as well as a hostile one.

    // A region is covered by as many watches as it takes: the hardware
    // watches at most eight naturally aligned bytes, so a 4096-byte page is
    // 512 watches and there are four of them. The tracker therefore covers
    // the largest prefix of each region that fits in the available slots,
    // widest watch first, and reports what it could not cover rather than
    // pretending the coverage is total.
    //
    // The strategy is deliberate. Covering the start of a region catches the
    // case that matters most -- a decoder that writes an instruction stream
    // from its beginning -- while spreading four watches thinly over four
    // regions would catch nothing at all in any of them. One region covered
    // deeply beats four regions covered partially, because a partial watch
    // that a target steps over is indistinguishable from no watch.
    //
    // The regions are served shortest first, which is the opposite of what a
    // reader would guess and is the whole reason this works. Four watches of
    // eight bytes cover 32 bytes; a program image has hundreds of kilobytes
    // of writable data, and the largest region would take every slot and
    // cover 32 bytes of a region the target treats as ordinary storage.
    // A short region, by contrast, can be covered *completely* within the
    // budget, and a completely covered region yields certain detection
    // rather than a sample. The slots are scarce enough that certainty is
    // worth more than reach.

    // does not stage its output in a region that existed when the process
    // started: it maps a fresh anonymous page writable, fills it, and then
    // makes that page executable. A tracker that armed its watches once, at
    // startup, would be watching the loader's data segments while the one
    // region that became code went unobserved.

    // Chasing is where the scarcity of debug registers has to be spent
    // deliberately. Watches on regions that have never been written to are
    // released to make room, because a watch that has not fired says only
    // that nothing happened yet, and a region the target has not touched is
