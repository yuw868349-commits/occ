// The isolation container.
//
// A container here is a process tree that has been given its own view of the
// system: its own mount table, its own process id space, its own network
// namespace, and its own root directory. There is no hypervisor and no
// kernel module. Everything is composed from primitives the kernel already
// exposes, which is why the setup path reads as a sequence of small
// operations rather than as a call into a container runtime.
//
// Order matters and is not arbitrary:
//
//   1. clone3 with the namespace flags. The new process is created stopped
//      behind a pipe so that it cannot run a single instruction before the
//      rest of the setup has happened.
//   2. Write the uid and gid maps. A user namespace starts with no mapping,
//      so the process inside has no valid credentials until this completes.
//   3. In the child: make the mount table private, so nothing that happens
//      next can propagate back to the host.
//   4. Assemble the new root. Overlayfs where a writable layer was asked
//      for, a plain bind otherwise, then pivot_root.
//   5. Attach to a cgroup, so the resource limits a caller asked for are in
//      place before any real work starts.
//   6. Install the seccomp filter last. It applies to the process that
//      installs it, so everything above has to finish first.
//
// Each step reports a failure at the point it happened. A container that
// half-exists is worse than one that never started, and the caller needs to
// know which capability the host is missing.

// the root is about to change, and a symlink resolved now would be
// resolved against the tree that is about to be replaced.

// `out` receives `root` followed by the folded target, which always names
// a path under the root: the fold resolves `..` against the names before
// it and drops a `..` that has none, so no target can reach above the
// root however it is spelled -- `/../x` and `/x` are the same path, and a
// `..` at the root stays at the root, which is what the kernel does too.
