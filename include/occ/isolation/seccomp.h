// Seccomp-BPF program construction.
//
// The filter bytecode is emitted here rather than delegated to libseccomp,
// because the kernel only ever executes bytecode: a library adds a policy
// compiler and a syscall-name table that are pinned to the library release
// rather than to the kernel the filter runs on, and both of those are things
// this project would then have to trust.
//
// Shape of a generated program:
//
//   load arch
//   if arch != AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64 -> reject every call
//   load nr
//   if nr > max_nr -> reject
//   jump to the block for nr, else fall through
//   ...
//   each block returns its action, or tests argument conditions first
//   fallthrough -> the policy's fallback action
//
// A syscall the policy does not mention is handled by the fallback, which is
// rejection unless the caller says otherwise. Default-closed is the only
// default that can be reasoned about: a syscall added by a future kernel is
// not silently permitted.
//
// The `nr > max_nr` test is not an optimisation. On x86-64 the kernel sets
// bit 30 of the syscall number for x32 callers, so a number seen at the
// seccomp boundary has to be rejected on the full value. A filter that
// dispatched on the low bits would let an x32 caller reach the native entry
// point under a different number.

// the underlying comparison fails.
// An earlier version of this header reached for BPF_JNE, BPF_JLT and BPF_JLE
// instead, which are eBPF opcodes: the kernel rejects the entire filter at
// install time, so a policy using one protected nothing. Every value below is
// exercised against a live filter in tests/test_seccomp.cpp.
